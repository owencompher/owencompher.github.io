        <p>These are some things that I've made or worked on. Generally larger/more recent things are listed first.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/owencompher/owencompher.github.io" target="_blank">My website</a> (which includes this page) is designed, built, and maintained entirely by me. It is mostly hosted on GitHub Pages. <br><br>
            <a href="https://github.com/owencompher/xl" target="_blank">xl</a> is a lambda calculus interpreter designed to extend any other language by implementing lambda abstractions. I want to eventually add more features to the program. <br>
            <br>
            Other things: <br>
            - <a href="https://github.com/owencompher/oBot" target="_blank">oBot</a>, a simple discord bot that I made for use by myself and friends. <br>
            - <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/desatur8" target="_blank">Desatur8</a>, a tiny color palette I designed to make pixel art with. <br>
            - <a href="convert.html" target="_blank">converters</a> in JavaScript, including base conversion and number to text. <br>
            - a <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=44055" target="_blank">Drum Kit</a>, which I made in the PICO-8 game console.
