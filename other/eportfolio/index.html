        <p>Welcome to Owen Compher's ePortfolio page<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;I am a web developer and am cooler than wix or weebly, so I thought I would just add this project to
        my existing <a class="link" href="https://owencompher.me" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

        <b>Reflection Statement</b>
        <p id="reflection" style="display: none; font-size: 18px; line-height: 25px" class="content">
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;
            I think the easiest thing to reflect on for this course is the fact that I am terrible
            at writing. I barely passed my high school English honors classes, I didn’t write an essay for
            any of my college applications, and the only reason I even took this course before 1101 is because
            I aced the multiple-choice part of the CLEP exam. ENC2135 has been just as hard for me as you would
            expect: at the time of writing this (December 6), there is a chance I will end up failing the course.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
            This is partly because I procrastinate way too much. I struggle to get the motivation to start assignments,
            especially if they are large ones or when I have no interest in the subjects. Everything in this course
            fits both of those perfectly. Although I did get to pick the topic, I am much more interested in solving
            technical problems (I am a computer science major) rather than writing or composing media. On all the projects
            in this course, I started right before or even after the due date, and I suffered because of it.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
            I am also not great at the actual writing process. I struggle to reach word counts, because I always feel
            like I can adequately cover the topic in fewer words. I also don’t usually do drafts, because I usually feel
            like what I write the first time is the best I am going to get, or the effort to re-write it is not worth the
            improvement. As a result, it takes my way longer to write fewer words, which in turn makes assignments feel
            even bigger, and then harder to get motivated to start it. On all of the projects in this course, I submitted
            at most one draft and I never met the required or recommended word counts.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
            Despite this, I do feel that I have learned a lot from this course – more than I have learned in all
            English throughout high school. Though my coursework may not reflect it, I think I have a better understanding
            of all the concepts this course was designed to teach. For Project 1, I had to learn how to compose a piece of
            writing without including any of my own ideas, which was tough for a lot of the students in my class. It was
            also the first time I had even heard about an annotated bibliography. Project 2 and the Believing and Doubting
            Game helped me build on critical reading skills a great deal. In addition to simply analyzing the argument and
            possible biases of the author, as I had learned to do in high school, I started thinking about how the genre
            conventions, affordances, and restraints, as well as the intended audience and rhetorical strategies related
            to the message and each other. As for my writing skills in general, I still need to work on the process and
            they way I approach writing assignments, but this class has been good for identifying those issues and showing
            me how to go about fixing them.

            If robots and AI ever get to the point where they can out-compete us for almost any job,
            how can we guarantee that society sees the benefits from the increased productivity? I
            feel like capital income tax and UBI will eventually be necessary for a non-dystopian
