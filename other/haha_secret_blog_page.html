    <p class="content" style="display: block">Obviously I didn't go through with blogging, but I don't like to
        delete things and thought I'd keep this page as a kind of easter egg for anyone who decides
        to look through the repo or sitemap for whatever reason.</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><pre>- 20211012</pre></button>
        <p class="content" style="display: block">I thought I'd start blogging, mostly for my own benefit. I think
        it will help me keep track of things and maybe improve my writing
        a little bit. I'm not sure how often I will post or what I will
        talk about in each post, but it will probably be about weekly and
        be about what I am generally doing and/or cool things I've found
        that don't deserve a spot on the 'Other' page.<br>
        Anyways, today I built this blog page. I'm pretty proud of the
        collapsible posts, which will be handy when (if) the page becomes
        full of them.</p>
