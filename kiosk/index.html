            <h2>2023-06-10 Northward - <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html">Devine Lu Linvega&#39;s journal</a></h2>
            <p>We&#39;re on our way north, anchored in Telegraph harbor. We&#39;ve preserved enough food to get us through the summer, and I&#39;ve stocked the shelves with <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/reading.html">books</a> to last us as long. I was especially happy about finding a copy of Carroll&#39;s <i>Sylvie &amp; Bruno</i>, and Golding&#39;s <i>Lord Of The Flies</i>, to carry along with us.</p>
	<p>To continue my research on concatenative language syntax inference, in contrast to the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnrea" target="_blank">reassembler</a> which create an intelligible textual representation from a binary file and a symbols file; this time, I&#39;ve written a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnfor" target="_blank">reformatter</a> that works from a textual source file and reindents it based on context. An interesting puzzle, considering how few syntaxic structures Uxntal has, lacking explicit notation for loops or even conditionals.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Found a way to removed the page limit of 32kb for the <a href="https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean" target="_blank">wiki</a>.</li>
		<li>By popular demand, the <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/docs">docs folder</a> is now browsable.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed playing with Bellinitte&#39;s <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~bellinitte/pinhole" target="_blank">Pinhole</a> renderer.</li>

            <p>i&#39;ve started working at least a bit on the New Game! there&#39;s nothing demo-worthy, mostly just a movement controller and a ton of bugs. and the movement controller doesn&#39;t even feel good, it&#39;s gonna need a lot of balancing &amp; polish for the game to work ok.</p>
  <p>as usual, here are a few somewhat-interesting things i found over the month or so i didn&#39;t post anything:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c0Y26iTPSM">here&#39;s</a> a video talking about taikyoku shogi, which i think i talked about a few months ago here. they actually got some people to play a full game of it. it&#39;s in japanese only but you could <i>probably</i> guess what&#39;s happening from context?</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars">here&#39;s</a> an internal wikipedia &#34;article&#34; about edit wars, a lot of it is pretty funny</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DliX_YFiSX4">here&#39;s</a> an interesting video essay about &#34;games that aren&#39;t games;&#34; all the games talked about are free (or can be emulated) &amp; seem pretty interesting. i can&#39;t run most of them because my computer is bad and/or the wrong operating system.</li>
    <li>the video essay also mentions <a href="https://www.increpare.com/">increpare games</a> which is pretty neat. most of the things on there are really hard sokobans which i can&#39;t even beat the first level of</li>
    <li>there&#39;s a new season of jet lag, it&#39;s in japan which menas more trains. <a href="https://youtu.be/8ZM_hPF1hsY">here&#39;s</a> a link to the first episode, new episodes are every wednesday i think</li>
  </ul>
  <p>hopefully i&#39;ll remember to update the music recommendations post at some point, i&#39;ve been listening to a lot of new music</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s get the bitching about work out of the way up front: my boss has been scheduling me full time for the past four weeks now despite knowing full well I&#39;m supposed to be working part time, and furthermore he had me working six consecutive days just now. Any more of this shit and I will straight up quit. Fuck you bro</p>
      <p>In brighter news, my finger&#39;s pretty much healed. That&#39;s pretty much it actually, between work and resting between shifts at work I haven&#39;t really had the time or energy to do much else. Remind me to burn down the capitalist system sometime.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve submitted a talk about <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html">permacomputing</a> to <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com" target="_blank">Strange Loop 2023</a> and it has been <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/an-approach-to-computing-and-sustainability-inspired-from-permaculture.html" target="_blank">accepted</a>. This summer, as we sail north, I&#39;ll be collating my notes on the overlaps between permaculture and situated software design practices — And, hopefully, have a substantial presentation by September.</p>
	<p>It&#39;s unbelieveable that we can sail up along the coast, find a pretty nook between two mountains that seems inviting, and just live there. When we&#39;ll have walked up and down the old trails to our heart&#39;s content, maybe we&#39;ll keep going. Part of me wonder for how long this will remain possible, it&#39;s just too good to last.

            <p>Greetings everyone! Today, alongside procrastinating on homework (help), I am working on a really cool personal project of mine! If you know me too wel, you may know that I am a part of the Countryhumans fandom, and I am working on my own universe/headcanons about them! So, i thought &#34;why not make some weird arg-like ish thing about them?&#34;, and so, here I am! I am working on <a href="https://n4chiverse.neocities.org/">a website</a> about them, and I am trying to make it similar to a plain, old-looking website, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040904153314/http://www.philippines.ph/">this</a>, except I used <a href="https://sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/">Sadgrl&#39;s layout maker</a> again XD (it&#39;s very helpful!). So, yeah. I&#39;m also working on changing the CSS of this website <i>yet again</i>, as I feel like it is pretty outdated to my own personal tastes. I&#39;m not sure now what to theme it after (except the fact that it&#39;s going to be something I like), so if any of you have any ideas, let me know! That&#39;s all, thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>So....... Honestly, I&#39;m still not that good until now. Something I really don&#39;t want to explain. Anyway, I got into this Nationstates game, and it&#39;s pretty cool! The people there are relatively chill too. Nationstates is a nation simulation game thing. Anyway, I made about three nations there, and so far I&#39;m having quite some fun there! Also, I feel like I&#39;d redo the CSS of this website <i>again</i>. Simply because... well, it does not fit me. Not sure why. Though, I think that&#39;s alright, at least I&#39;m updating this website to my tastes (and saving the css files on txt files anyway. I feel like animating again. The problem is, I don&#39;t have time and motivation. I have a lot of character concepts to put into final designs. I hope I could do it this summer. WISH ME LUCK!</p>

            <h2>2023-05-12 Type Inference Week - <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html">Devine Lu Linvega&#39;s journal</a></h2>
            <p>For a few weeks now, I&#39;ve been sketching the basis for a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal_types.html">type inference</a> system for Uxntal. I first came across a stack-effect validator when writing <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-inference.html" target="_blank">Factor</a>, and I&#39;ve been meaning to make my own since after reading Rob Kleffner&#39;s <a href="https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/blog/static/stack-languages-talk-notes.pdf" target="_blank">talk notes</a>. Prior to this project, I had a sense of what the different constructions were, but writing a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/type_systems.html">type-checker</a> drew clearer lines between all these different patterns.</p>
	<p>We&#39;re casting off for <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html" target="_blank">Desolation Sound</a> in a few days. Most afternoons are spent stocking up <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/pino.html">Pino</a> with enough food to last us until we make our way back south next autumn. I&#39;m eager to depart.</p>

            <p>today-ish is the spinny game 2nd anniversary! unfortunately i am terrible at time management etc. and the update is nowhere near finished. it&#39;s not too big of a problem cause probably nobody cares the exact date at which i add a small amount of content to my very bad webgame, although it means i won&#39;t get to start work on the other game for a while longer. stay tuned for the 2.somethingth anniversary i guess.</p>
  <p>speaking of arbitrary milestones, i&#39;ve almost reached 100000 reviews on anki! this means literally nothing but i guess i&#39;m making progress on things??</p>
  <img src="https://jmibo.neocities.org/assets/ankisomething.png" width="100%" alt="some cool anki stats, i guess"/>
  <p>as usual, here are some cool things i found. the journal entry was delayed a bit because i couldn&#39;t think of anything to put here before.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      some random things relating to jazz fusion band Casiopea, because i was looking at a bunch of random things relating to the jazz fusion band Casiopea and i found them pretty interesting:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1lC0FnuI0KbHmwCvQuPcvkpda2nnsoo">mint jams</a> is a very nice album by them, it&#39;s the first music of theirs i listened to. anyway for some reason i got recommended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsStb0xbF9Q">this</a> cover(?) of the album using the mario 64 soundfont. it&#39;s pretty good</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TakYy45dhBk">here</a>&#39;s them playing each other&#39;s instruments it&#39;s sort of funny</li>
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/jVqCc14UP48">here</a>&#39;s a thing where they&#39;re taking turns doing really short solo sections, it&#39;s pretty funny. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edc2yVHRHiQ&amp;t=0s">the full song</a> is worth a listen, as is (probably, i haven&#39;t finished it yet) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBD1_mrRUIk">the full concert</a>. it&#39;s a collaboration between them and another band that i know like nothing about but seems pretty good as well.</li>
        <li>pretty much all the live performance footage on youtube of them is really neat and worth checking out if you like this sort of music</li>
        <li>i should stop talking about casiopea</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">here</a>&#39;s a pretty interesting article about &#34;enshittification,&#34; the process by which platforms get progressively worse for both users and business customers.</li>

            <p>It&#39;s been one hell of a month since I last posted here. If you&#39;ve made the baffling decision to get invested in my life, I&#39;ve got good news and bad news. Bad news first.</p>
      <p>Work isn&#39;t going very well. One of my coworkers quit and that&#39;s left us understaffed for May long weekend, which is an incredibly busy time. I&#39;ve been scheduled for 48 hours next week(<span style="color:red;">!!!</span>). To put that in context, I signed up to work part time. 20-30 hours a week they said. Hopefully they can hire someone <em>soon</em>.</p><p>
      </p><details>
        <summary>Content warning here - the short version is I injured my hand, and I&#39;m gonna talk about that. Nothing life-altering, though. It&#39;ll heal and I&#39;ll probably be fine.</summary>
        The next awful thing that happened to me is I sliced my left index finger open on a knife at work. I won&#39;t give a play-by-play of events, but suffice to say the cause was very embarrasing. Luckily (for a given value of lucky) it was a sharp, non-serrated knife, so the cut was clean at least. I left the hospital a few hours later with three stitches right next to the *pause for googling* Distal Interphalangeal Joint. There was, understandably, disciplinary action on the part of my employer, but nothing major. I wasn&#39;t fired, at least, so that&#39;s good, I guess.
      </details>
      <p>Also, my Matrix server is seeing about zero use. Once again, nothing has changed in the wake of a scandal regarding Discord. lol</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Now for the good news. I&#39;ve come into some money for reasons that boil down to &#34;the government is simping hard over my autistic swag&#34;, which is a sentence I&#39;ve been itching to say, and I used some of it to get a 3D printer! Blog post about it possibly coming soon, but suffice to say it&#39;s been a thoroughly fun and interesting experience.</p>
      <p>I also made a fursona. One guess what species it is. You will be able to find out more once I&#39;ve gotten around to making a <a href="https://github.com/theHedgehog0/fursona-schema">spec</a>-compliant <a href="https://me.deeptwisty.com/.well-known/fursona">information file</a>.
      </p><hr/>
      <p>I&#39;m starting to get sick of writing these in raw HTML. Might fuck around and write a custom Markdown renderer in PHP. Could be fun.</p>

            <p>I recently watched David Ungar&#39;s <i>Everything You Know About Parallel Programming Is Wrong</i> talk, which lead me to read Tony Hoare&#39;s <i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i>, after which I felt inspired to consider <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/parallel_computing.html">parallel computing</a> once more, and soon found myself taking a detour to play with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language)" target="_blank">OCCAM programming language</a>, and revisit threads in Uxn.</p>
	<p>As a side-project, unrelated to threads, I made a pixel-perfect implementation of the classic Macintosh Note Pad application, so I could keep notes throughout the day and that turned out to be a fantastic aid to collecting passing thoughts. While building it, I also had a chance to implement text-wrapping in a project with very few moving parts and better understood how to handle text selection, where the boundary of a selection ends up being before the original anchor, and implemented it in <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/left.html">Left</a>.</p>

            <h2>2023-04-22 Structured Editing - <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html">Devine Lu Linvega&#39;s journal</a></h2>
            <p>These past few months, I&#39;ve explored <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/computation.html">playful things</a> to do with programming that might not directly serve a purpose, or at least, one wouldn&#39;t come across them without seeking them out specifically, and I&#39;ve collected some of those seemingly useless, ideas into a talk and submitted it to the <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com" target="_blank">Strange Loop</a> conference happening in September.</p>
	<p>Also, while I consider <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/beetbug.html">Beetbug</a> to be a kind of <i>disassembler</i>, I wanted to see if I could build something that would let me go from a source file to an assembled rom, and back again. I figured that being able to recover a project from a rom and its symbols file has important potential in terms of data preservation. To make this possible, I modified the <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/symbols.html">symbols file</a> to include comments, and was able to complete the back and forth I wanted.</p>
	<p>This allowed me to experiment with something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor" target="_blank">structured editing</a>, in which you modifying the underlying structure, symbols and bytecode of a program, and not its structural representation.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added an interactive mode to <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html">Drifblim</a>.</li>
		<li>Started building a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnrea">reassembler</a>.</li>
		<li>Added a type port to the <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html#console">Varvara Console</a> device.</li>

            <h2>2023-04-10 - <a href="https://me.deeptwisty.com/blog/">blog</a></h2>
            <p>Pretty good vibes this morning. Got up at 6 AM (or never slept? hard to tell with my sleep schedule) and made like five fried eggs and some half-burnt toast. It was fucking delicious. Great distraction from the Horrors. It is now 7 AM and very bright out. Yesterday was Easter, apparently. Don&#39;t really care to be honest with you.</p>
      <p>I set up a Matrix server recently. Hoping beyond hope that it can help ease some of the friction of eventually migrating off of Discord. Either way, I encourage you to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@w:isopod.zone">hit me up there</a> so I have an excuse to use it.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Update! Just got back from a walk along some trails in the nearby woods. I was out two hours, walked around three kilometers, and came back very, very tired. It was probably the longest recreational walk I&#39;ve ever been on. I have to wonder, at what point does a walk become a hike?</p>

            <p>Happy Easter, everyone!</p>
	<p>I know, I know: the <em>unhinged</em> part of this journal is
	steadily taking over. I’m starting to lose interest in updating
	<em>anything</em>. This is unfortunate, but I’m not
	in a good mood recently, so the things I do that may be appropriate to
	put here are discarded because “Who would care?”. Moreover, I realised
	that a journal can be only so much private and without references to my
	actual identity – and that’s a thing I wanted to avoid when I started
	writing here. The issue is I can only be so vague and still write
	<em>something</em>.</p>
	<p>I started consulting a professional: maybe she will help me brush
	off my constant feeling of not-being-enough-ever. I really hope so.</p>

            <p>haven&#39;t been very productive recently, mostly just have been busy with less important things. starting to fall behind on my flashcards a bit but hopefully i&#39;ll be able to catch up with em soonish.</p>
  <p>some more cool things again, there are only like two of them again:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a friend of mine made <a href="https://taelsdafoox.itch.io/tanuki-defusal-co">this game</a> fairly recently, i think it&#39;s really neat &amp; tightly designed. there aren&#39;t too many mechanics (the gist is that going down slopes increases your speed, being on the ground decreases your speed, and you can buffer jumps to avoid being on the ground for long enough to decrease your speed at all) but they work together really well &amp; it&#39;s pretty fun optimizing your route etc. only one level at the moment but it&#39;s incredibly solid. my best time is 0&#39;59&#34;64 which is not great (i think it&#39;s possible to shave off about four seconds of that). recommend checking it out.</li>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/qm9N_SPhwR8">here</a>&#39;s another one of those knife-making videos, this time involving microwaving sand. i have absolutely no clue what&#39;s going on because i&#39;m not good at science but it&#39;s fun trying to figure things out with the minimal explanation. all of these videos (that i&#39;ve seen; there are a lot of them) are just really fun to watch, good brand of humor, etc.</li>
    <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1xrXrgQDQzTlGrDYhX8ikT?si=7b85ab25cfe04614">here</a>&#39;s an album that i thought was pretty nice. no real comments. except that it is not, in fact, in four tone equal temperament, which would have been expected from the artist name. false advertising etc</li>

But the game is nearly finished now, there are fewer and fewer bugs, and most of my time is spent doing optimization.</p>
	<p>I&#39;ve been diving into <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/interaction_nets.html">Interaction Nets</a> again, and I&#39;ve fallen head over heels with Sato&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/inpla/inpla" target="_blank">Inpla</a> language, the code is a nightmare but I feel that with a bit of work, and a better division between the interpreter and virtual machine, this could turn out to be something very fun.</p>
	<p>After watching Alan Kay&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY" target="_blank">OOPSLA 1997</a> talk, I went and read <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/reading.html">Smalltalk-80: Bits of History, Words of Advice</a> and I&#39;ve been fascinated with it.

  <p>i decided to actually try playing chapter 9 of celeste again and managed to get past the worst room this time! everything past it has been a lot easier but i expect i won&#39;t be able to beat the whole chapter (esp. if i try for the moonberry)</p>

            <h2>2023-03-26 - The Trip to Boston - <a href="https://doctordizzy.neocities.org/journal/">Dizzy&#39;s Bunny Hell</a></h2>
            <p>Long time, no see. Sorry for the total lack of updates lately! I do kinda want to talk about the website first, since I feel like I have a few things relating to it that I want to talk about.</p>
                            <p>So, first off -- The website is currently undergoing some big update. I was going to have it be put on hiatus until then, but I&#39;m a huge procrastinator, so I&#39;m just kinda rolling out updates as I make them. This does mean that several pages are completely out of date, or they&#39;re a bit broken, or whatever else, but I&#39;m hopeful that I can have everything updated in the near future. ^_^</p>
                            <p>Hmm... Other online ventures are basically regulated to just the Metal Gear Database, the independent <em>Metal Gear</em> wiki that I founded. An admin from the <a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Fallout_Wiki" target="_blank">Independent Fallout Wiki</a> has been such a huge help with this, and I owe her my life. Most recently, she forked the entire Metal Gear Fandom wiki over! This will definitely be very helpful to me, and I seriously can&#39;t wait to continue editing and revamp every single page. Sadly, I can&#39;t right now, because.... I&#39;m on a trip!</p>
                            <p>As of typing this, I&#39;m actually suffering in a five hour layover in New Jersey, but I went on a trip to Boston for <a href="https://east.paxsite.com/" target="_blank">PAX East 2023.</a> My mom was the one who got the tickets and did some planning, though I&#39;m totally going by myself next year. I do feel like I&#39;m a bit behind when it comes to &#34;adult stuff&#34;, and my inability to drive and my having very few independent experiences kinda solidify that. But I digress! Let&#39;s talk about the trip, shall we?</p>
                            <p>So... Thursday. My mom got tickets for Friday and Sunday (When I go next year, I totally want to go for all four days...!), so we were good to go on Thursday. Because my dad is going through chemotherapy, he couldn&#39;t really take us to the airport in the early morning. Fatigue is a total bitch. My mom scheduled a Lyft to take us there, and we were off at 5 am!</p>
                            <p>... Then, we were back once my mom realized that she lost her driver&#39;s license when we were already halfway to the airport. She apologized profusely to the driver, then spent about 45 minutes trying to find her license when we were home. All of that time lost meant that we made it to the airplane just by final boarding... &gt;_&gt;</p>
                            <p>... But enough of that. This is about my trip to PAX, not complaining about random events. I could talk about the admittedly very nice hotel, or other various experiences, but.... PAX............</p>
                            <p>Now, I had my Big Boss ita bag, which I put quite a bit of time into. I&#39;m totally gonna post the pictures of both it and my Kirby ita bag (Which I also brought, of course!) as soon as I can! I really need to figure out a way to properly organize this journal page, and inserting images just causes more clutter for now. Suffice it to say that it looks <em>damn</em> good. I had on my beautiful beanie, which had various pins decorating it that made it look even cuter, I had my heart shaped glasses, which made everything look just a little bit pinker and made me <em>adorable</em>, and I had a lanyard with <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> characters! Truly, I was ready to roll.</p>
                            <p>And roll I did. There&#39;s a sign when you walk in saying &#34;Welcome home&#34;, and I have always felt that was apt, especially now that I know the Boston convention center rather well. It <em>is</em> a home to me. The people there share my interests, I can talk to them about whatever, it&#39;s a joy that I can&#39;t get anywhere else and I was ecstatic!</p>
                            <p>The convention itself... Holy shit. The cosplays were beautiful. The panels were fun. I was so unbelivably happy. I don&#39;t want to share the photos I took of the cosplayers, since I feel like that may be a minor breach of privacy, but I saw a Rose Quartz, Bowser, Big Boss (Who I paused right when he was about to go up the escalator -- He laughed in glee when he saw my ita bag, and did the &#34;You&#39;re pretty good!&#34; hand gesture when I took the picture!! ^_^), and a few lovely ladies in lolita dresses. One of them even had a Goro Majima ita bag! :O That was such a surprise to see!!</p>
                            <p>But, of course, conventions are more than just walking around and seeing cool cosplays. There are also the panels, and those were very exciting as always! The first panel I went to was about cosplaying when you&#39;re neurodivergent, especially ADHD. I&#39;ve always been a bit nervous about cosplay for numerous reasons, and seeing people talk about it and how being neurodivergent has impacted their ability to cosplay, kind of madae me feel a bit more confident in it. I have both ADHD and OCD, and while I don&#39;t <em>think</em> those would impact my ability to cosplay too much, there are still nuances relating to both that I think that I should keep in mind if I ever want to get fully involved in the hobby.</p>
                            <p>Pretty shortly after that was another panel in the same room about the Nintendo Gamecube. Appropriately enough, it was called something like <em>The Nintendo GameCube Was the Greatest Console Ever Made</em>. There was no arguing over <em>why</em> it was the greatest console, it was simply an accepted fact that it was. The first thirty minutes were dedicated to talking about the GameCube, the panelists&#39; memories of the GameCube, their favorite games, etc. etc. The last thirty minutes were spent building the perfect collection of GameCube games, with the limit being fifteen. There were ten games to start out with, and audience members had to convince three out of five panelists to add a game of their choosing. If there were already fifteen games, the audience member also had to argue for <em>removing</em> a game from the lineup! I remember that someone went up and shook the hand of someone who argued for the removal of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 Battle.</em> XD </p>
                            <p>I did go to one other panel at the end of the con, though I sadly didn&#39;t see it to its completion. While it was about speedrunning, a very interesting topic to me, I just... I had been there since 9:00 AM. I have pretty severe anxiety, and while Zoloft is a godsend for that, I just... Couldn&#39;t keep being around people. I could feel the signs of an oncoming panic attack, and had to exit the panel thirty minutes early.</p>
                            <p>That was... Honestly the only negative about the convention. I didn&#39;t even talk about the expo hall yet! I withdrew sixty bucks, anticipating a lot of money spending, but for a while, nothing really caught my eye. Until, of course, I stumbled across a booth selling some tech stuff. Controllers were the main draw, but those keyboards... They were beautiful... I got a full sized keyboard for $30, and it&#39;s pink, and it&#39;s fantastic to type on, and I love it so much, and I&#39;m absolutely stoked about it! I also got an <em>Ace Attorney</em> desk mat and <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> pin from Fangamer, and that was really about it in terms of expo hall purchases. I did find myself in possession of a cute <em>Kirby</em> sticker <em>and</em> a <em>Pokémon</em> card, though. I saw someone with an <em>adorable</em> Kirby ita bag, and I <em>had</em> to stop her and tell her how cute it was! I showed her mine, and she said that it was adorable, then she asked if I wanted a <em>Pokémon</em> card and Kirby sticker, and of course I said yes!! Her bag also had a Vineshroom pin, and we talked about Vinny for a bit, which was a joy.</p>
                            <p>... On the topic of Vinny...</p>
                            <p>Vinesauce has been... One of the most influential things that I have ever watched. I&#39;ve been watching Vinny especially since middle school, and I&#39;m in college now. That should tell you how important he is to me. He&#39;s seriously been an absolute lifesaver in so many ways, and when I heard that he was doing signings and photo ops, I was just... I wish I could say that I was overwhelmed with joy, but I was mostly just incredibly anxious. I made my way to the booth where he was doing the signings, I waited in line for like an hour, the moment finally came and I got a Red Vox flexi disc of their newest album, I was hyperventilating and told Vinny that I had serious anxiety, and he said &#34;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s me. Hello, nice to meet you.&#34;</p>
                            <p>My eyes were stinging, I was so happy about this. They were giving out free stress balls shaped like brains (They said &#34;Brainyot&#34; on them, which is always appreciated. XD), and I was given one, and I got to talk about Red Vox with him, and we talked about music and his music for a while and that was amazing, and I got to shake his hand because I <em>asked</em> and I told him that I owed him my <em>life</em> and all he said was &#34;No, you don&#39;t,&#34; and I said that I really <em>did</em> and he turned to me and said &#34;You know what I say? If it weren&#39;t for me, you would have found somebody else. But thank you, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re still here.&#34;</p>
                            <p>I honestly don&#39;t really remember much of what happened after that moment, it was all kind of a breeze. I&#39;m just so happy that Vinny is as kind as I thought he would be. Like, right after I told him about how anxious I was, he said that he was pretty anxious as well, but that it got easier as you got older. That shit seriously means a lot to me. I know that it&#39;s probably a bit silly, and I&#39;m definitely trying to move away from parasocial relationships with Twitch streamers, but that moment was one that I will never forget.</p>
                            <p>(By the way, he signed my iPod.)</p>
                            <p>Honestly, the rest of the convention was mostly just sitting around, maybe going to the AFK room (A quiet room with coloring books where you aren&#39;t allowed to speak; very useful if you just want quiet.), and generally existing. It was still just... Such a great time.</p>
                            <p>The next day was not. My mom rented a car, we drove to Rhode Island to that we could say we&#39;ve been to Rhode Island, we drove to Connecticut, my mom hung out with her coworker friend, I was on my period and overemotional and started crying numerous times... It was seriously a mess. The fact that my mom messed up with scheduling flights and the Sunday flight would leave at <em>12:00 PM</em> instead of basically any later time just rubbed salt in the wound.</p>
                            <p>I didn&#39;t even go to the convention today. Friday had overwhelmed me with sound, the panels I was interested in started in the afternoon, I didn&#39;t feel comfortable going to the very interesting looking event where you learned how to play Dungeons and Dragons if I was just going to leave early, and... I just wanted to get out of there.</p>
                            <p>One flight later, and... Here we are. In the Newark airport, waiting for a flight that leaves at 7:55. I can&#39;t wait to go home, but honestly? Even if the weekend wasn&#39;t the best, Friday more than made up for it. This was a really fun trip, and I for one cannot wait for next year.</p>

            <h2>2023-03-25 - <a href="https://me.deeptwisty.com/blog/">blog</a></h2>
            <p>So, it has once again Been A Minute. Not that I owe a bunch of purely hypothetical strangers on the internet an explanation, but about the best I&#39;d be able to do is alluding to a general vibe of overwhelmed-ness. But nevermind that, on to... something.</p>
      <p>So Discord did another evil thing. This time it was the fact that they quietly removed the provision from their privacy policy saying that they wouldn&#39;t record call data and then announced a bunch of AI features. Discord has had about fifty zillion scandals in the past, but this is the first time it actually got my friends talking about alternatives! Nothing much came of it though.</p>
      <p>I&#39;m ostensibly working on a blog post comparing alternatives, but that got stalled around the same time as everything else. I&#39;ll summarize here: switch to Revolt if you&#39;re scared of change but also don&#39;t mind incomplete, buggy alpha software, switch to XMPP if you and everyone you know are huge nerds and more comfortable with how software worked in the 90s, switch to Matrix otherwise or if you value easy-to-use end-to-end encryption, if the only feature of Discord you use is group DMs then use Signal, unless you value gimmicks, then use Telegram. Under no circumstances use Guilded.</p>
      <p>Now feels like a good time to mention that I have email and Matrix addresses listed <a href="https://me.deeptwisty.com/links">here</a>.</p>
      <p>I&#39;ve also switched Linux distros, from Manjaro to EndeavourOS. My install was kind of falling apart in various non-critical ways and I felt like I needed a fresh start, and Manjaro seems to be going from the Ubuntu of Arch derivatives (complimentary) to the Ubuntu of Arch dertivatives (derogatory).</p>
      <p>I was also starting to get sick of KDE. It&#39;s extremely powerful and configurable in theory, but both the GUI and command-line tools to do that are generally crummy and unreliable at best and every single component generates config files that it feels like you&#39;d need a PGP key to interpret. Now I&#39;m running XFCE - it was my DE of choice back when I was running Linux on a Chromebook, and I can see why I used to like it. It&#39;s not as fancy or polished (or memory hungry), but it&#39;s way more straightforward to configure and when it breaks it typically does so consistently and for much simpler reasons.</p>
      <p>There&#39;s some other shit in here too, uh... <code>*sound of papers ruffling*</code> strongly considering getting a 3d printer... don&#39;t really like my job but it&#39;s better than being broke... oh! I fixed the port forwarding for my Minecraft servers! I&#39;m pretty sure ufw was causing my problems in some way, though I don&#39;t know what, because I managed to get it working by removing all the Minecraft rules from ufw and just adding the relevant iptables commands to my wireguard config instead. I also made a cronjob to ping the servers hourly to see if they&#39;re up, which is pretty cool, I think.</p>
      <p>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for the moment. Now I need to upload this post before I&#39;m forced to update the date in the HTML I&#39;m currently hand-writing.</p>

            <h2>2023-03-21 - <a href="https://clatto.neocities.org/journal">Welchia&#39;s Journal</a></h2>
            <p>I have a couple of stuff that were from my mom. There&#39;s this Twilight book that my mom never read, but bought before because apparently it was popular at that time (I haven&#39;t read it either but I know it&#39;s very weird), there&#39;s these old photo albums, and snippets from a newspaper, but also, apparently my mom got a copy of some guidebook to Lotus 1-2-3, and it gave me a rash while I&#39;m reading it. Honestly, I&#39;m intrigued by it. I love how the wording in the book describes the program as something new, as something revolutionary, comparing the usage of the program as a replacement for traditional office work. Although I wasn&#39;t born at that time, I somehow feel old from reading the book, haha. Anyway, here&#39;s some video commercial about it: <br/> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cNJNKkCQ2E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>

            <p>Hello! So, we gave our cats away, I am kind of being mentally better, and my mom trusts me to be left alone when she goes out to her new business, whic, as of now, is not thriving. Although, I do wish the best for her. Since this website looks too much tinted, I might change the CSS of this a bit, not much, just some changes to the colors and stuff. That&#39;s all for now.</p><p>
